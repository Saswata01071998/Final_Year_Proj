  The concept of online learning or e-learning is growing popular everyday. There are apps in the online
app store catered to the needs of children without additional requirements. Itâ€™s high time to effectively
use technology and child psychology to cater to the needs of children with special needs and
developmental disorders. <br>
  The idea is to provide music aided computer-based learning to children diagnosed with Autism
Spectrum Disorder and other developmental disorders. To instill within them the concept of e-learning
through our android application named Mela (Music-based E-Learning App). Our app focuses on
children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder in the age group of 3 to 6 years. Starting at an early
stage will help them build upon their cognitive skills and teach them to be self-dependent. Music has
been used as our primary tool to help them learn as they play.<br>
